This is a project for fine tuning a Bert model.


The target is to classify how much score would a user may give to an app (TikTok) by the review provided.

The code is also available for other text classification tasks.


The result was uploaded but it is not good enough as hardware limitation, this result was ran on an i5 CPU and was trained for 3 days. So if you have better device or GPUs, you may have a much better result.
